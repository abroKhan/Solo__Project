            <h3 class="primary__heading">Swat Valley</h3>
            <p>It is one of the most famous archeological sites of the Buddhist period. Swat was said to be filled with
                1400 beautiful stupas and monasteries. They were used as worship houses for 6,000 gold images of the
                Buddhist and also for creating awareness about the Buddhism religions through education.</p>

            <h3 class="primary__heading">Kumrat Valley</h3>
            <p>The valley is fascinatingly beautiful though its raw beauty is being spoiled at a rapid rate by
                uncontrolled litter left by the tourists. The easiest route to reach Kumrat Valley is through
                Timargarha. 8 km short of Dir, a road leads to the right for Kumrat.</p>

            <p> The Khyber Pass has historically been a gateway for invasions of the Indian subcontinent from the
                northwest. Indeed, few passes have had such continuing strategic importance or so many historic
                associations.</p>
